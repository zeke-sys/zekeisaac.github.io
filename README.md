<ins>**About This Portfolio**</ins>

This is my personal portfolio website, built from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to showcase my technical skills, professional background, and software projects in a clean, responsive, and modern interface.

The site includes several key sections:
- Home Page – Features a dynamic daily greeting, a hero section highlighting my background, and a brief introduction.
- Projects Page – Displays my technical work with project cards, descriptions, and links.
- About Page – Provides an overview of my experience, certifications, and interests.

Beyond presenting my work, this portfolio demonstrates my ability to:
- Build responsive layouts from scratch
- Implement UI animations and theme toggling
- Structure modular, well-organized front-end code
- Create visually polished components using modern CSS techniques

More features and projects will be added over time as I continue to grow and expand my technical capabilities.
